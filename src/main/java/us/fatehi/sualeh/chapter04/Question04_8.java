/**
 * 4.8 You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value.
 * Design an algorithm to print all paths which sum up to that value.
 * Note that it can be any path in the tree - it does not have to start
 * at the root.

public class Question04_8
{

  /*
   * Let’s approach this problem by simplifying it. What if the path had
   * to start at the root? In that case, we would have a much easier
   * problem: Start from the root and branch left and right, computing
   * the sum thus far on each path. When we find the sum, we print the
   * current path. Note that we don’t stop just because we found the
   * sum. Why? Because we could have the following path (assume we are
   * looking for the sum 5): 2 + 3 + –4 + 3 + 1 + 2. If we stopped once
   * we hit 2 + 3, we’d miss several paths (2 + 3 + -4 + 3 + 1 and 3 +
   * -4 + 3 + 1 + 2). So, we keep going along every possible path. Now,
   * what if the path can start anywhere? In that case, we make a small
   * modification. On every node, we look “up” to see if we’ve found the
   * sum. That is — rather than asking “does this node start a path with
   * the sum?,” we ask “does this node complete a path with the sum?”
