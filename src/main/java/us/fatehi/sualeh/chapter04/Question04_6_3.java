  /*
   * For any node r, we know the following: - If p is on one side and q
   * is on the other, r is the first common ancestor. - Else, the first
   * common ancestor is on the left or the right side. So, we can create
   * a simple recursive algorithm called search that calls search(left
   * side) and search(right side) looking at how many nodes (p or q) are
   * placed from the left side and from the right side of the current
   * node. If there are two nodes on one of the sides, then we have to
   * check if the child node on this side is p or q (because in this
   * case the current node is the common ancestor). If the child node is
   * neither p nor q, we should continue to search further (starting
   * from the child). If one of the searched nodes (p or q) is located
   * on the right side of the current node, then the other node is
   * located on the other side. Thus the current node is the common
   * ancestor.
