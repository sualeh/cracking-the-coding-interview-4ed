  /*
   * We approach this problem by thinking very, very carefully about
   * what happens on an in-order traversal. On an in-order traversal, we
   * visit X.left, then X, then X.right. So, if we want to find
   * X.successor(), we do the following: 1. If X has a right child, then
   * the successor must be on the right side of X (because of the order
   * in which we visit nodes). Specifically, the left-most child must be
   * the first node visited in that subtree. 2. Else, we go to X’s
   * parent (call it P). 2.a. If X was a left child (P.left = X), then P
   * is the successor of X 2.b. If X was a right child (P.right = X),
   * then we have fully visited P, so we call successor(P).
