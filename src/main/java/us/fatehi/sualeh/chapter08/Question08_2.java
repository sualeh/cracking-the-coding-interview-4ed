/**
 * 8.2 Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left hand corner of an NxN
 * grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How
 * many possible paths are there for the robot? FOLLOW UP Imagine
 * certain squares are “off limits”, such that the robot can not step on
 * them. Design an algorithm to get all possible paths for the robot.

  /*
   * Part 1: (For clarity, we will solve this part assuming an X by Y
   * grid) Each path has (X-1)+(Y-1) steps. Imagine the following paths:
   * X X Y Y X (move right -> right -> down -> down -> right) X Y X Y X
   * (move right -> down -> right -> down -> right) ... Each path can be
   * fully represented by the moves at which we move right. That is, if
   * I were to ask you which path you took, you could simply say “I
   * moved right on step 3 and 4.” Since you must always move right X-1
   * times, and you have X-1 + Y-1 total steps, you have to pick X-1
   * times to move right out of X-1+Y-1 choices. Thus, there are C(X-1,
   * X-1+Y-1) paths (e.g., X-1+Y-1 choose X-1): (X-1 + Y-1)! / ((X-1)! *
   * (Y-1)!) Part 2: Code We can implement a simple recursive algorithm
   * with backtracking:
