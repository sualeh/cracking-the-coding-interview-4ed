   * use [0, n/3) »»for stack 2, we will use [n/3, 2n/3) »»for stack 3,
   * we will use [2n/3, n) This solution is based on the assumption that
   * we do not have any extra information about the usage of space by
   * individual stacks and that we can’t either modify or use any extra
   * space. With these constraints, we are left with no other choice but
   * to divide equally.
