/**
 * 3.4 In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods
 * and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The
 * puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top
 * to bottom (e.g., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You
 * have the following constraints: (A) Only one disk can be moved at a
 * time. (B) A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod.
 * (C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk. Write a
 * program to move the disks from the first rod to the last using
 * Stacks. pg

   * 1 to Rod 2 2. Move Disk 2 from Rod 1 to Rod 3 3. Move Disk 1 from
   * Rod 2 to Rod 3 Can we move the top three disks? 1. We know we can
   * move the top two disks around from one Rod to another (as shown
   * earlier), so let’s assume we have moved Disk 1 and 2 to Rod 2. 2.
   * Move Disk 3 to Rod 3 3. Again we know we can move the top two disks
   * around, so let’s move them from Rod 2 to Rod 3. This approach leads
   * to a natural recursive algorithm:
